# Problem Statement

#You are given a square matrix of size NÃ—N. Can you calculate the absolute difference of the sums across the two main diagonals?
# Input Format
#  The first line contains a single integer N. The next N lines contain the rows of N integers describing the matrix.
# Output Format
#  Output a single integer equal to the absolute difference in the sums across the diagonals.

# Sample Input
#  3
#  11 2 4
#  4 5 6
#  10 8 -12

# Sample Output
# 15
